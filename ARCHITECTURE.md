## 🎯 Design Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- **I**nterface Segregation: No client should depend on methods it doesn't use
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Shared utilities and common functionality
- Reusable components and services
- Centralized configuration

### Clean Code
- Descriptive naming
- Small functions and classes
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling

## 🔒 Security Features
- JWT Authentication
- Password hashing with BCrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests (Domain layer)
- Integration tests (Application layer)
- Contract tests (External services)
- End-to-end tests (API endpoints)
- Code coverage with JaCoCo

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging
- Health checks
- Metrics collection
- Distributed tracing
